# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I keep procrastinating starting to review coding after doing over 6 months of visual coding in Bubble.io but it's about time I say enough is enough and get on with it. Thus I decided to partake in this challenge; though must be noted, I am the obsessive type so I will most likely do over an hour a day on some days.

### Day 1: February 13, 2023)

**Today's Progress**: Although this isn't my official start date of coding, since I started FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course last week (I think on Feb9, 2023). As of right today, I am on "Learn CSS Colors by Building a set of colored markers."

**Thoughts:** I've always known that I've found CSS and HTML pretty straightforward. I find that I've also always enjoyed it but for someone who's been doing visual programming, it's felt nice to get back into it. The refresher was definitely needed.

**Time spent:** Over an hour

### Day 2: February 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I began by doing a bunch of Javascript and Git activities that were part of LHL's Prep Work program so that I could refresh my mind on JS syntax and using the Command Line again. 

**Thoughts:** I'm finding that this feels like second nature and I've truly missed writing JS code. Feels good to be back baby!

**Time spent:** Over an hour

### Day 3: February 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started doing more JS and CLI practice work; more importantly, set up GitHub and VSCode on this new windows computer I recently got. I've also finished the section I was on in FreeCodeCamp's activity from Day 1.

**Thoughts:** It's been a productive but tiring day. There's so much I want to learn and don't feel as though there's enough hours in the day. Perhaps it's just because I realize I've gotten so much slower at coding so I'm slowly adjusting.

**Time spent:** Over an hour

### Day 4: February 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: YAY I finished the section I was on in FreeCodeCamp's activity from Day 1 (colored markers) and also began building a registration form.

**Thoughts:** It's been a productive day! Oh how I missed coding! Feels so good to be back! I already find myself getting faster at this and the fact that I'm remembering things so quickly... I love and am proud of me!
